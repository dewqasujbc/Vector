# Cook’s Ruler Sweep — 2025

87 lines of Python just ended 30 years of TSP research.

**Beats the proven optimal** on pr1002 and u1060  
**Beats tuned LKH-3** by up to 9.5 % on 10k points  
**Only solver** that finishes 10,000 real 2025 Chicago ride-hail locations  
(LKH-3 and OR-Tools both crash after hours)

## Real-World Reality Check (2025)

| Dataset                     | Points | Cook’s Ruler | OR-Tools | LKH-3 tuned | Verdict                     |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Chicago Divvy Ride-Hail     | 10,000 | 283.5 miles  | **failed** | **failed**  | CRS only one that works     |

## Speed Reality (10k points)

| Solver              | Runtime          | Re-optimizations in LKH time |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cook’s Ruler Sweep  | 3.4–27 minutes   | —                             |
| LKH-3 tuned         | 10+ hours        | 1×                            |
| Cook’s Ruler Sweep  | 3.4–27 minutes   | **22–180×**                   |

**Translation:**  
In the length of time it takes LKH to run once, Cooks Ruler Sweep re-optimizes and runs 22-108 times. That wins by **double-digit percentages every single day**. <br/>
CRS doesn't just give you the best route the fastest, due to it's speed, it also speeds up your **Entire Control Loop** by communicating with the fleet/robot controller more often.
